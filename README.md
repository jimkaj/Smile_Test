# How Videos of People Smiling Can Explore the Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making
Our project aimed to explore two findings related to human judgment and decision making by analyzing a
large data set of online survey data. The first finding relates to the “wisdom of the crowd” phenomenon.
When trying to answer some question of uncertainty, it’s been found that if you take a large number of
individual estimates and then average them, the average is often very accurate. This phenomenon was
popularized in James Surowiecki’s book The Wisdom of Crowds. A second finding is what’s known as the
overconfidence bias. People tend to be confident more than they are correct. Such overconfidence often
contributes to decision aide neglect (Sieck & Arkes, 2005), making it a pivotal topic for decision scientists
who may find themselves data modeling to make decision aides. We demonstrate these principles and perhaps
advance the field by examining a data set of individuals attempting to guess whether a person smiling is
being genuine or not.
